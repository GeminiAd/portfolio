## Description 
This is just a simple website that shows off the applications that I have worked on. It also shows off my css skills, as this website is all HTML/CSS, no JavaScript.

## Key Features
This website was created entirely by me using HTML/CSS.

There's a navigation bar at the top with links to each of the three sections: the about me section, the section showcasing my work, and the contact 
me section. The about me section has a recent picture of me, my name, and a short description of me, including my skills. The work section showcases my work: I have my most recent project displayed larger than the other projects on the top row. The other projects are displayed below the most recent project, with two projects per row. Whenever you hover over an image of my project it brightens up the image as if you are selecting it. Each project image, when clicked, takes you to the deployed application - or, in the case of placeholder projects, just takes you to a placeholder image. The contact me section has some links to contact me.

This website also boasts a responsive design. On smaller resolutions - indicative of viewing this site on a tablet or smartphones - I reduced some of the text and image sizes so the site doesn't look broken. It should look good when viewed on a desktop, laptop, tablet, or smart phone.

## Usage 
This project portfolio looks beautiful on desktops and tablets!
It looks pretty good on smartphones as well! I would encourage you to view it on a desktop, a tablet, and a smartphone to see its full responsiveness.
